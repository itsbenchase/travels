<h1>Transit Travels</h1>

<p>Welcome to a collaborative website of transit riders tracking exactly how much transit distance they've covered throughout their travels. This website is based off of the <a href="https://eliotindex.org">Eliot Deviation Index research project</a>, and the project remains as the original source of all of the route data on this site.</p>

<p>This site and the route data here remains in constant development as of August 2024. Not every desired route may be included at this stage (to be honest, just contribute to the EDI research project for more routes here).</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To track your own travels, get started today through our <a href="https://github.com/itsbenchase/travels">GitHub repository</a>, which is updated periodically with new travel logs. The <a href="route.html">route info page</a> on this site is also helpful for determining where your traveled segments begin and end.</p>

<p>You can also just contact Ben and they'll set you up as soon as possible.</p>
